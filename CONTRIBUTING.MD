Adding an Opportunity

Keep in mind you can add internships, co-ops, or full-time jobs.

First step is to fork this repository.

Then, you can add your opportunity. Each row in the opportunity table is for a company. In other words, each row should correspond to a unique company. A row should look like this:

Please be sure to add the opportunity in alphabetical order.
